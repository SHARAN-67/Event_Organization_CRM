# 📟 Command Center: Operational Intelligence Report

## 1. 🏗️ Program Structure & Architecture
The Command Center is built using the **MERN Stack**, following a decoupled Client-Server architecture designed for high-availability and secure event management.

### 📂 Directory Map
- **`/client`**: The React-based Command Terminal (Frontend).
  - `/src/context`: State management for Authentication and RBAC.
  - `/src/navigation`: Sophisticated Sidebar and Layout management.
  - `/src/pages`: Modular feature interfaces (Reports, Analytics, Leads).
  - `/src/theme`: Dynamic UI skinning engine.
- **`/server`**: The Node.js Mission Intelligence Hub (Backend).
  - `/models`: Mongoose schemas defining the data structure.
  - `/routes`: RESTful API endpoints for module communication.
  - `/middleware`: Security gating and token validation layers.

## 3. 🛠️ Technologies & Stack Details
### 💻 Languages
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Used across the entire stack for seamless logic flow.
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Utilized with modern Glassmorphism and Neon aesthetics.

### 📚 Core Modules (Frontend)
- **React 18**: Component-based UI rendering.
- **Vite**: Ultra-fast build tool and development server.
- **Lucide React**: High-fidelity iconography.
- **Axios**: Promised-based HTTP client for API synchronization.
- **React Router 6**: Client-side navigation and routing.

### ⚙️ Core Modules (Backend)
- **Node.js**: Asynchronous JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Backend web framework for API routing.
- **Mongoose**: Elegant MongoDB object modeling.
- **Multer**: Handling multi-part data for secure file uploads.

## 4. 🔒 Security Protocols (The Aegis System)
Security is implemented through a multi-layered approach:

1.  **Identity Verification**:
    *   **BCrypt Hashing**: Passwords are never stored in plain text. They are processed through a salted, one-way cryptographic algorithm. (See Section 4.1 for details).
    *   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Stateful sessions are avoided. Each request requires a crypographically signed token in the header.
2.  **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**:
    *   Users are assigned roles: **Admin**, **Lead Planner**, or **Assistant**.
    *   Permissions are validated per-feature (e.g., An Assistant can Read Leads but cannot Delete them).
3.  **Data Masking**: Sensitive lead data is masked for lower-clearance roles.
4.  **Vault Storage**: Documents and reports are stored as binary buffers in the DB, rather than public folders, preventing unauthorized file sniffing.
5.  **Lock Station**: A global UI lock that requires a dedicated clearance password to re-engage the terminal.

### 4.1 🛡️ Deep Dive: Bcrypt Password Hashing
The Command Center utilizes **Bcrypt** for credential security, which is significantly more secure than standard SHA-256 or MD5 hashing.

*   **One-Way Integrity**: A Bcrypt hash is irreversible. The system stores a "digital footprint" rather than the password itself.
*   **Cryptographic Salting**: Every password is automatically "salted" with random data. This ensure that even if two users have the same password, their hashes in the database look completely different, neutralizing "Rainbow Table" attacks.
*   **Adaptive Cost Factor**: We use a cost factor of **10**, meaning the algorithm performs multiple rounds of internal hashing. This deliberate computational "slowness" makes brute-force attacks computationally expensive and unfeasible for hackers.
*   **The Validation Loop**: During login, the server hashes the user's input and performs a secure comparison against the stored hash. If they match, access is granted without the server ever knowing the raw password.

## 5. 🗄️ Database & Real-Time Management
The system utilizes **MongoDB** for its flexible, document-oriented storage.

### Data Management Strategies:
- **Instant Synchronization**: The UI uses React's state hooks and Axios intersections to reflect database changes immediately without page reloads.
- **Buffer Streaming**: Files are stored as `Buffer` types in the database and streamed to the client only upon verified request.
- **Operational Logs**: Every mission-critical action (logins, deletions, approvals) is recorded in a tamper-resistant Activity Log.
